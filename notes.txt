vid 8 . in react-router-dom

    def the product route in <main>
     <Route path="/product/:id" component={ProductScreen}></Route>
    <Route path="/" component={HomeScreen} exact></Route>
    the path="/" refers to the home screen, and the component to render is HomeScreen component, and exact means to run only if it is exact

    also cut the imports for data and Product from App.js and paste in HomeScreen.js, change the ./ to ../ as the file is ina another folder
